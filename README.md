# Song Hit Prediction
College 5th Sem Summer Training Project

This is a machine learning project, that aims to classify whether a given song will be "Hit" or "Not Hit". User enters lyrics in English language, and the application gives the prediction. We used Sci-kit learn NLP modules. Used Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.

## Motivation
This project was created by a team of `3 members`. We looked for various projects that focused on songs. We found some innovative projects that carry out analysis. Taking many different projects as a reference to make a summer training project, we thought of predicting a song's popularity in a way that uses different approach compared to other projects. 
> Sometimes we would hear from people that _old songs were popular because of their lyrics._
We then decided to try analysing a song on the basis of its lyrics.

## Tech/Framework used
Project implemented in Python.
Used `Anaconda` Framework for implmentation and using required Python libraries and modules.
Libraries used:
-pandas: For dataset tasks.
-sklearn: for transformation, vectorization, naive bayes algorithm model.
-sklearn_pandas: for DataFrameMapper.
-nltk: nltk.corpus for stopwords
-textblob: for TextBlob , lemmatization
-tkinter: for GUI.


## Dataset
Collected own data from Spotify, using spotipy module. Dataset collection Jupyter notebook given under [MokshVerma repository](https://github.com/MokshVerma/Hit-Predictor-5000/tree/master/Project) having the name `Dataset-Creater-3000.ipynb`.
